## LocalPDF - Merge PDFs, Optimize PDFs, Extract Images and more!
> Local PDF uses Webassembly to edit your PDFs inside your Browser. Your files won't leave your System, they will not be sent to another server

This Website uses [pdfcpu](https://github.com/pdfcpu/pdfcpu "pdfcpu") and is based on [this](https://dev.to/wcchoi/browser-side-pdf-processing-with-go-and-webassembly-13hn "this") article by [wcchoi](https://github.com/wcchoi "wcchoi").

Currently, we support Merging PDFs, optimizing PDFs, and extracting Information like Images from PDF Files as well as adding watermarks!
